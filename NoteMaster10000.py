NoteMaster 10000
----------------

The NoteMaster 10000 is a program that allows the user to create note a dictionary of notes filed under keywords which is saved
to an external text.dat file. The user can also search by key or by text, and delete all instances of a note across keys,
or a key, including all the notes it holds. The user can also use the combobulator to find the common (uncommon) words between
two notes - intended as a stimulation to making conceptual connections.
